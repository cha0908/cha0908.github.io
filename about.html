I grew up in Hong Kong and came to Boston in pursuit of knowledge and university degree. My journey to computer science is an unconventional one, with my first computer science experience being </p>
            <p class="about">I had the opportunity of interning at Salesforce this past summer, where I worked on some database security-related projects. In general, I’m fascinated by any and all topics--my first CS course was at Berkeley, so I haven’t really had the chance to carve out a niche yet.</p>
            <p class="about">A few personal notes: my favorite sport is soccer, although we call it “football” where I come from (also the rest of the world, but I digress). I actually spent a good number of my middle and high school years playing for the Hong Kong National Football Team, which was pretty cool. I’m also left-handed, but that only holds true for eating and writing--I throw and hold rackets with my right. I have 3 brothers and a dog named Tofu, so my house used to get quite chaotic when we were younger.</p>
